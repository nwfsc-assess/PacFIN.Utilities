  PACFIN_SPECIES_CODE = "('CNRY','CNR1')",
  PacFIN_Common_Name = NULL,
  UID = PacFIN.Login,
  PWD = PacFIN.PW,
  minYr = 1900,

}
\arguments{
\item{PACFIN_SPECIES_CODE}{A character vector of PacFIN species code or codes. For species with a nominal category use, e.g.: PACFIN_SPECIES_CODE = "('PTRL', 'PTR1')".
Otherwise, for major species that are always separated out in the catch use: e.g.: PACFIN_SPECIES_CODE = "'SABL'".}

\item{PacFIN_Common_Name}{A character vector of PacFIN species common name used only for checking for a nominal species ID. The function will stop after the species codes are printed.}

\item{UID}{A character vector of for the PacFIN login. The default is 'PacFIN.Login', which can be set prior to running this function.}

\item{PWD}{A character vector of for the PacFIN password. The default is 'PacFIN.PW', which can be set prior to running this function.}

\item{minYr}{The minimum year for which data is to be extracted.}

\item{maxYr}{The maximum year for which data is to be extracted.}

\item{verbose}{A logical object. When TRUE, verbose output will be printed. When FALSE, only differences and ratios of INPFC and PSMFC areas will be printed. The default is TRUE.}

\item{addColsWithLegacyNames}{When TRUE, historically used columns will be copied and given legacy names, mostly from the 'vdrfd' PacFIN table. The default is currently TRUE.}
}
\value{
An R list with the following data frames: 'CompFT' contains the comprehensive Fish Ticket information; PacFIN.INPFC.Summary.Catch' is catch summed over INPFC areas by year, agency, and port;
'PacFIN.PSMFC.Summary.Catch' is catch summed over PSMFC areas by year, agency, and port; Catch.mt.by.Agency.Year.Fleet is catch summarized by agency, year, and fleet, 'Tribal.Catch.mt.by.Year.Gear'
is tribal catch data summarized by year and gear type.

\description{
Extract commercial fisheries catch data from fish tickets supplied by fish processing plants when the fish were delivered. 
This data is archived in the Comprehensive_FT table contained within the PacFIN (https://pacfin.psmfc.org/) database.
