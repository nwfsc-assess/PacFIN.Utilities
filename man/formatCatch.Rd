\title{Format Catches from Long to Wide}
\usage{
formatCatch(catch, strat, valuename = "catch")
}
\arguments{
\item{catch}{A data frame with at least a column specifying
the year the catches took place (e.g., Year), a column for
each of the variables specified in strat, and a column that holds
the measured catches specified using the \code{valuename} argument.}

\item{strat}{A vector of column names to stratify the output over.
For example, if you wish to summarize by ageing method, then the argument
would look like \code{strat = "agemethod"}.
Or if you want to look at fleets and gear, then use
\code{strat = c("fleet","usegear")}.
# todo: deprecate defaults}

\item{valuename}{The column name that contains the 
catch values in \code{catch}}
}
\description{
Transform a long data frame of catches to a wide data frame.
The colnames of the wide data frame will be in the format
needed for the statification of stage-2 expansions of
composition data, i.e., \code{getExpansion_2}.
}
